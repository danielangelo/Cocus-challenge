# CocusProject

## Objective
One of many tasks that we do on a daily basis is to take notes so we don’t forget about things.
So, there should be an awesome way to do this right? Your goal is to create a Notes Application that allow us to take very simple notes that uses **Browser Storage**.

## What we expect
We expect to have a fully functional Frontend in Angular.
We want to be able to add notes with a Title, check those notes, check the detail of a
note, edit a note and delete the ones we don’t need anymore.

## Bonus
 Add Encryption to the notes before storing.
 Add a Docker File.
 Add Markdown Support.
 Add Multiuser Support.
 Add note sharing between users (requires multiuser support)
 Add note tagging or grouping
 Add possibility to link notes
 Add printable version
 Add possibility to save note as pdf
 Add versioning of notes
 Filter notes in list view
 Import / export all notes from storage
 Insert images into notes
 Search notes
 Sort notes in list view

It is not expected that all optional features are implemented. They are sorted alphabetically and not by priority. Feel free to pick the ones you like and/or be creative and add own features.

Please send us the code on a public repository or simply zip it and send by email.
